- Play: just plays an audio file
    play my_audio.wav
    (listens for user input that specifies if audio is to be stopped, paused,
    skip 15s, returned 15s, volume raise, volume lowered)
    play my_audio.wav -s 50 (play from 50 seconds forward)
    play my_other.wav -t 1:23 (go to minute one second twenty three)
    play hello_world.wav --fade-in 30 (30 seconds fades in)

- A Cue Player - that performs system stuff as well as playback, meaning like:
        cue_player start
        (here it listens to user input)
        // Wherever it says cue_player it means that the user is in run mode
        // and cueplayer should listen to the command next to it:
        // cue_player start
        // define --cue 20 --stop my_audio_file.wav --fade-out 100ms
        // the command line should be divided in two halves, the first half
        // where the user puts their commands and sees previous commands
        // (regular command line interface)
        // The second where they see the cue list like:
        // 23 play my_audio_file.wav
        // They can also alias their audio files by another name
        // define --cue 30 --play sweet-kitty-2334_download_xo029.mp3 --name "Sweet Kitty"
        // 30 play "Sweet Kitty"
        // If they write a number the cue goes off:
        // 30
        // Cue 30 playing...
        // There should also be another window bellow the cue list that shows
        // all the cues that are currently playing.

        cue_player define --cue 23 --play my_audio_file.wav --fade-in 500ms --fade-out 300ms
        channel set  1: left-right (wait for user input)
        channel set  2: center-surround-left
        beginning time: 1m2s
        finish time: 2m2s
        // perhaps other specifities, but user can quickly save progress and
        // the program knows sets the remaining settings to default
        // or user can keep the default setting of a certain parameter and can skip
        // to the other one


        cue_player reset --cue 23 channel
        channel set 1: (choose other option)

        cue_player show --cue 23
        (Outputs all settings set in group, with the posibility of expanding on
        a group of settings)
        cue_player show --cue 23 --set faders

        // They can also set system stuff
        cue_player settings
        (Output will be list of settings they can change)
        cue_player settings --set-output my_audio_interface
        (Output may be Success or Failure, if failure show the available outputs)
        cue_player settings --show-output
        (Output shows current output card)

        // User can also perform system tasks such as:
        cue_player define --cue 3 --record my_new_recording_cue3

        // Can import files into the project directory or point to those files
        cue_player show list
        (output of current files in the directory being used)
        cue_player show
        (will output the project settings)
        cue_player show --cues
        (will output cue list and some metadata)
        cue_player import my_personal_cue_list.qlab
        (We can import qlab cues and some parameters)
        cue_player link my_other_cue_list.cp
        (There can be in future another tool for creating samples, more
        directed at musicians and designers who need more freedom and are not
        concerned with specifity. And that other tool communicates with this one
        through a shared cue_list file that both are modifying. Designer can be
        in different computer making changes to audio-related stuff from the cue
        such as effects, fades in, cut points, etc. While this one will have
        the capabilities to do things with the system such as access the systems
        io, net and stuff like that that only a systems person knows,
        it can also provide better documentation at the end of the day.)
